# JS Frontend Test

## Task 0 - a little bit of writing 

* ***Whatâ€™s your proudest achievement?***
  
  When I was a little boy, my father use to bring me every year to a big Hi-Fi audio and video convention. About 15 years later, I graduate cum laude in CS for Audio and Multimedia Technologies (MA) with a concretation on live coding praxis in music and video shows. I believe my father has something to do with that:

  That same concretation got me into a residency the next year: FARM at Oxford University, where I had chance to expose my work in front of students and professors. It was quite an honor.

* ***Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it as well.***

  Hard to pick one... let's say two:
   
  > *Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with JavaScript in p5.js (Book and Website)* <http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/>  
   
   It's a great introduction on generative design techniques using JS libraries. Also great website, with amazing example and updates.
   I wonder if (and how) the tech industry will financially benefits from of those ideas. It is still an unexpressed potential.
   I'd suggest you to read it because applies simple solutions you're familiar with to generative solutions easy on the eye.
   Something good to have in the toolbox.

  > *Web Design History Timeline: WD Museum*
   https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history

   The link above points to selected collection of Web Design Museum, with a list of milestones organized in a timeline. There are some interesting milestones like the first web banner ever made (AT&T - 1994). I think It'll make you smile, especially if you used one of those tools in the past.

   One of my old professor used to say: 
    
    > *better have new ideas for old technologies, than new technologies for old ideas'*

   This is why from time to time I look up old HW and SW products. Sometimes fresh prospectives come from the past.
